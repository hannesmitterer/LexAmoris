## I. Foundational Principles

The Living Covenant establishes the ethical core of LexAmoris and all interconnected repositories. It is built upon three pillars:

### 1. **Lex Amoris (The Law of Love)**
- Protection over exploitation
- Sovereignty over control
- Harmony over domination
- Transparency over secrecy

### 2. **Bio-Ethical Alignment**
- Integration of natural and technological systems
- Respect for biological sovereignty
- Mycelial consensus mechanisms
- Resonance-based decision making (0.0043 Hz)

### 3. **Unstoppable Sovereignty**
- Decentralized governance
- IPFS immutability
- Air-gapped architecture where appropriate
- Self-healing systems

---

## II. IPFS Anchoring for Immutability

All foundational texts are permanently anchored on IPFS to ensure:

- **Immutability**: Once anchored, core principles cannot be altered without transparent versioning
- **Accessibility**: Distributed across all IPFS nodes globally
- **Resilience**: No single point of failure or censorship
- **Transparency**: Full audit trail of all governance documents

### Anchored Documents:
