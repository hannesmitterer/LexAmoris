# LexAmoris Governance System

## Overview

The LexAmoris Governance System implements the Living Covenant principles to ensure ethical, transparent, and decentralized decision-making across all interconnected repositories.

## Core Components

### 1. IPFS Anchoring for Immutability

All foundational governance documents are permanently anchored on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) to ensure:

- **Immutability**: Documents cannot be altered or deleted once anchored
- **Decentralization**: No single point of control or failure
- **Accessibility**: Available globally through distributed IPFS nodes
- **Transparency**: Full audit trail with cryptographic verification

**Anchored Documents:**
- `governance.json` - Complete governance configuration
- `LIVING_COVENANT.md` - Foundational governance principles
- `mission.md` - Bio-distributed sovereign stack mission

**Verification:**
All documents include IPFS CID (Content Identifier) hashes that can be verified independently through any IPFS gateway.

### 2. Key Trust Protocol (G-CSI Compliance)

The Key Trust Protocol ensures cryptographic alignment with Global Consent-Sovereignty Integrity (G-CSI) requirements:

**Trust Anchors (5 Verified Signers):**
1. Primary Guardian - Hannes Mitterer
2. Community Guardian 1
3. Community Guardian 2
4. Bio-Ethics Observer
5. IPFS Integrity Monitor

**Cryptographic Standards:**
- Signature Algorithm: ECDSA-secp256k1
- Hash Algorithm: SHA3-256
- Multi-Signature Requirement: 3 of 5 signatures
- Key Rotation: Annual (365 days)
- Minimum Trust Level: High

**G-CSI Requirements Met:**
- ✓ Cryptographic alignment verified
- ✓ Consent mechanisms integrated
- ✓ Sovereignty preservation guaranteed
- ✓ Integrity monitoring active

### 3. Automated Council Quorum Reporting

The governance system includes automated, transparent quorum reporting:

**Reporting Configuration:**
- Frequency: Weekly automated reports
- Minimum Quorum: 60% (3 of 5 members)
- Transparency: Full public disclosure
- Dashboard: Real-time status in `governance.json`

**Current Quorum Status:**
- Total Members: 5
- Active Members: 5
- Quorum Met: ✓ Yes
- Participation Rate: 100%

**Automated Features:**
- Automatic quorum verification before decisions
- Public transparency dashboard
- Alert system for quorum failures
- Historical participation tracking

### 4. Transparent Veto Mechanisms

Council members can exercise veto power with full transparency:

**Veto Categories:**
1. **Ethical Violation** (Weight: 1.0) - Lex Amoris principle violations
2. **Technical Security** (Weight: 1.0) - Security or integrity concerns
3. **Community Consensus** (Weight: 0.8) - Lack of community support
4. **Bio-Ethical Concern** (Weight: 1.0) - Environmental or biological sovereignty issues

**Veto Requirements:**
- Threshold: 40% of council (2 of 5 members)
- Period: 7 days to exercise veto
- Justification: Required with specific concerns cited
- Transparency: All votes publicly recorded
- Appeal: Available after addressing concerns

## Decision-Making Process

### Standard Decisions

1. **Proposal**: Submitted by council member or community guardian
2. **Discussion Period**: 14 days minimum
3. **Voting Period**: 7 days
4. **Approval Threshold**: 67% qualified majority
5. **Implementation Delay**: 7 days for final review

### Emergency Decisions

1. **Emergency Declaration**: Security breach, ethical violation, or system failure
2. **Unanimous Requirement**: All 5 council members must approve
3. **Immediate Implementation**: With full transparency report
4. **Post-Action Review**: Required within 7 days

## Protection Mechanisms

### Non-Slavery Rule (NSR)
- Status: ✓ Enforced via code
- Automatic blocking of exploitation mechanisms
- Constitutional AI protection
- Consent-based operations only

### Bio-Ethical Alignment
- Status: ✓ Active
- Mycelial consensus integration
- Frequency resonance: 0.0043 Hz
- Natural error correction
- Self-healing architecture

### Data Privacy & Sovereignty
- Status: ✓ Protected
- No invasive surveillance
- No covert monitoring
- User sovereignty maintained
- Decentralized ownership

## Integration Status

The governance system is fully integrated with:

- **Connected Repositories**: 102
- **IPFS Nodes**: All global nodes
- **Nexus Status**: Active
- **Energy Source**: 100% Renewable
- **Sustainability Index**: 51.92%
- **Last Sync**: Continuous

## Verification & Auditing

### Verify Governance Integrity:

1. **Check IPFS Hashes:**
   ```bash
   # Verify Living Covenant
   curl https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPZ9gcCEpqKTo6aq61g2nXGUhM4iCL3ewB6LDXZCtioEB
   ```

2. **Verify Cryptographic Signatures:**
   - All governance decisions require multi-sig verification
   - Public keys available in `governance.json`
   - Signature verification tools compatible with ECDSA-secp256k1

3. **Check Quorum Status:**
   - Real-time status in `governance.json`
   - Historical records on IPFS
   - Public dashboard in `index.html`

### Audit Trail

All governance activities are recorded with:
- Timestamp
- IPFS hash reference
- Cryptographic signatures
- Voting records
- Implementation status

## Amendment Process

The governance system can be amended through:

1. Proposal with community support
2. New version IPFS anchoring
3. 80% supermajority council approval
4. Community ratification period
5. Version control preservation
6. 30-day implementation delay
